-- C. Challenge Payment Question
-- The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 
-- that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
--    - monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
--    - upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
--    - upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
--    - once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

--4 If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, 
-- what questions would you include in the survey?

-- Ans:
-- Why you have cancel our sservice, Is there any perticular raeasin?
-- What suggestions you like to add to our plan scheme?
-- Are the price rates fair as your point of view?
-- Which plans you prefered the most?
-- How did you know about our services?


--5 What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? 
-- How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?

--Ans:
--Bussiness levers: 
-- 	sell price (sell high)
-- 	ourchase cost (buy low)
-- 	sales performance (sell more)
-- 	cost to serve (manage your expenses)
-- Here,
-- analyze the churn occurence
-- Engage with customer through email, websites,cha,clog,social meadia
-- Check for customer comaplaints
-- Ask for feedback
-- take risk assessments in periodic manner
-- give better services to each customers
-- we can adjust our pricing scheme according to market
--Then we can validate the company's growth in results
